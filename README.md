# Flatline [WIP]

#### Open apps directly in GNOME Software by clicking Install from Flathub and apps.gnome.

### Instalation

1. [Enable Epiphany extension](https://github.com/GNOME-Web-Extensions/Get-Started/wiki#how-to-enable-extensions). _Optional if not done._
2. Clone this repository.
`git clone https://github.com/GNOME-Web-Extensions/Flatline.git`
3. Follow this [tutorial](https://github.com/GNOME-Web-Extensions/Get-Started/wiki#how-to-install-extensions).

## Roadmap
To facilitate the installation process of Flatpak applications through the websites flathub.org and app.gnome.org, I created this simple extension that, through appstream, opens GNOME Software directly in the app's details panel.

### Support
- [x] Flathub
- [x] Apps GNOME

## Special thanks
I want to thank [Lains](https://github.com/lainsce) for taking the trouble to create such a cool icon, thanks also to Nahuel for bringing the idea to the table.
